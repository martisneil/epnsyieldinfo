webapp  for instant info on EPNS yield and returns calculator 


EPNS has yield farming Dapp(https://incentives.epns.io/) through which push tokens can be staked and rewards(push tokens) be harvested. However, getting any info on the incentive programs and the statistics involved requires users to connect to the Dapp via aa web3 wallet such as metamask. Also, the Dapp doesn't have an inbuilt yield calculator which if present can greately help potential crypto investors to make a informed decision on staking. The current Dapp(un-official) gives an ability for users to: a) view the historical yield performance , b) view key yield metrics and c) calculate furture expected returns, without requiring any wallet connect or wallet address.
